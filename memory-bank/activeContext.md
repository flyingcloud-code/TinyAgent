# Active Context: TinyAgent
*Version: 1.0*
*Created: PLACEHOLDER_DATE*
*Last Updated: PLACEHOLDER_DATE*
*Current RIPER Mode: NONE (START Phase Active)*

## Current Focus
Currently in START Phase - Step 4: Project Scaffolding. We are setting up the basic project structure, creating necessary directories, configuration files, and initializing the development environment for TinyAgent.

## Recent Changes
- PLACEHOLDER_DATE: Created projectbrief.md with core requirements extracted from PRD
- PLACEHOLDER_DATE: Created techContext.md with technology stack decisions
- PLACEHOLDER_DATE: Created systemPatterns.md with system architecture definition
- PLACEHOLDER_DATE: Created progress.md and activeContext.md to complete Memory Bank structure

## Active Decisions
- Directory Structure: IN PROGRESS - Deciding on optimal folder organization for tinyagent module
- Configuration Location: PENDING - Whether to place configs in root or within tinyagent module
- Package Management: PENDING - Using requirements.txt vs pyproject.toml

## Next Steps
1. Create tinyagent directory structure with core, llm, mcp, cli modules
2. Create initial configuration files (llm_config.yaml, mcp_agent.config.yaml)
3. Create requirements.txt with initial dependencies
4. Complete Step 5: Environment Setup
5. Complete Step 6: Memory Bank finalization
6. Transition to DEVELOPMENT phase

## Current Challenges
- Time System: Unable to retrieve current datetime for proper timestamping
- MCP Integration: Need to research openai-agents-mcp extension availability and alternatives
- Python Version: Need to confirm optimal Python version (3.9+ assumed)

## Implementation Progress
- [✓] Memory Bank Structure Planning
- [✓] Requirements Documentation (projectbrief.md)
- [✓] Technology Selection (techContext.md) 
- [✓] Architecture Design (systemPatterns.md)
- [✓] Progress Tracking Setup (progress.md)
- [✓] Active Context Setup (activeContext.md)
- [ ] Project Directory Structure
- [ ] Configuration Files Creation
- [ ] Requirements File Setup
- [ ] Environment Configuration
- [ ] Initial Python Module Setup
